# analyze-A-B-test-results

An A/B test is run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. The goal is to to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

Hypothesis testing is used to help the company make the decision backed by data. Various other techniques of practical statistics such as probability, sampling are also used. Regression is used to fit a model and achieve the same result.
